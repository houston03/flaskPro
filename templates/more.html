<h2>About me</h2>

        <div class="card0">

            <h4>&#8212 I started studying programming in depth in 2022. I started with Python, mastered many libraries, various GUI tools, HTML, CSS, DB, machine learning, AI. I've also had to work with someone else's code, but that's a plus, because it's important to understand what your colleague is thinking. And of course, the word mastered is inappropriate here, because it is impossible to know everything. But I have a desire to study, to learn new programming languages, so that someday I can say "I have mastered".</h4>

<h2>Additional education</h2>

            <h4>&#8212 I mainly studied on my own, however, I took Python courses in the Stepik, Yandex application, and regular courses on YouTube, because sometimes there is very useful information there. Courses in DB, SQL, Machine learning, Data science. Since the courses were mostly free, only 5 of them were certified. </h4>

            <h4>&#8212 But the main thing is knowledge.</h4>
